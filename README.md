## Description

The Unreal Engine is one of the state-of-the-art 3D rendering engines, mainly used for game development. In recent years, however, its use in industry and science has been steadily increasing, which is further supported by new features from the producer Epic Games Inc. This course gives an in-depth training to using Unreal Engine as a data generator – by gaining measurements from virtual worlds. Using the ground truth data generated with a realistic rendering engine, projects gain more robust AI pipelines, insight into AI performance on quantifiable data, as well as measurements from virtual scenes with environmental conditions that can be manipulated. 

At the end of the course, participants have setup their own pipeline with UE and a simple ML workflow in one of the leading supercomputing centres.
